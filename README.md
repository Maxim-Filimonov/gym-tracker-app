# Gym Exercise Tracker

This app lets people that regularly go to the gym track their exercise results in every session, allowing them to review their pervious results, so that with each new session, they can use the results of the previous session as the goal to beat (or match) for the current session. Over time the person going to the gym will be able to see how they have improved. 

### App Usage Walkthrough

During the first week, a gym goer can create a new session, specify the type of session (e.g. legs, chest, back), and record the following:
- each exercise completed within that session (e.g. for a legs session this can inclue leg press, hex bar deadlifts, barbell squats, split squats)
- the number of sets for each exercise (e.g. 3 sets), 
- the weight lifted for each exercise 
- the maximum number of reps achieved within each set for the given exercise.

The next week, the gym user has access to the previous weeks session information (session type, exercises, number of sets, weight lifted, max reps for each exercise). They create a new session (as per the first week), however this time they will have access to the previous session data (weight lifted and max reps), which will be set as the goal for the current session. The aim is to match or beat the results from the previous session, in order to improve.

This continues week after week, and over time the gym goer can see how the weight and maximum reps for each exercise have improved since the first week.
